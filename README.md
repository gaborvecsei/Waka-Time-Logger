# Wakatime logger

:sunglasses: :sunglasses: :sunglasses:

## TL;DR

"Extend" the *Wakatime Free Plan* so you won't loose your logged data!

## Info

This is a Python script which you can use to log you times from *Wakatime*.

*Wakatime* offers that with a `Free Plan` you can access your logged times for `2 weeks`.
Unfortunately this means that your times will be hidden after a week and only accessible after upgrading to Premium.
So this is why I made this project. If you run it at least `once a week` you will have **ALL** your logged times.
You don't need to run it manually, you can use *Heroku* and *Slack*.

Note: You can export your coding activity from the [WakaTime Settings page](https://wakatime.com/settings) even on the Free plan.

## Usage

- [with Heroku](https://github.com/gaborvecsei/WakaTime-Logger/tree/master/wakatime-logger-Heroku)
- [Manual](https://github.com/gaborvecsei/WakaTime-Logger/tree/master/wakatime-logger-Manual)

## TODO

- saved data visualization

## Disclaimer

I do not encourage anybody to use this scrip instead of a purchase for a Wakatime plan.
Your can upgrade the plan [here](https://wakatime.com/).
This is only an awesome project
for the usage of the Wakatime API. :v:
